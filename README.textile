h1. x2go module for Puppet

This module provides classes to manage x2go client, server and thin client environment (aka tce).

You may choose to use either the baikal version (only bug-fixes) or the main.

h2. Examples

* To install the x2go client:

    @class { 'x2go::client': }@

This sets ensure => present for the package. If you want to set a different
value, you can override the x2go::params::ensure parameter using hiera.

* To remove the x2go client:

    @class { 'x2go':   version => 'baikal', }@
    @class { 'x2go::client::absent': }@
    
    
* To install a x2go thin client environment

bq. class { 'x2go::tce':  
      version => 'latest', 
      x2go_chroot => '/opt/x2gothinclient/chroot',  
      export_2_network => '192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0',
    }
      
    
   You will probably have to customize your installation: see the "x2go wiki":http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/wiki:advanced:tce:install

* see the files under test for more examples
